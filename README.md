# Static-Routing-and-VLAN-Configuration-Lab

## Project Overview
This lab focuses on configuring static routes and VLANs between multiple networks using Cisco routers and switches. The goal is to establish connectivity between workstations over a serial connection by assigning IP addresses, setting up VLANs, configuring trunk links, and defining gateways of last resort. The project combines concepts like IP addressing, VLAN configuration, and routing to create a functional network setup.

## Key Steps
1. **Router Configuration**: Assign IP addresses to router interfaces and enable them.
2. **VLAN Setup**: Create VLANs and assign them to switch ports.
3. **Trunking**: Configure trunking to support multiple VLANs over a single link.
4. **Static Routes**: Implement static routes between networks to ensure proper communication.
5. **Gateway of Last Resort**: Set up a default route to handle unmatched traffic.


## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation.
- Basic knowledge of Cisco CLI commands.
